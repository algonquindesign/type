Each of you will be given the name of a modern-day typographer. You'll research them to create a profile including:

- General biographical information
- A head-shot if possible
- A synopsis of their career
- Notable typefaces they've designed, with prominent samples on your page so we can see their designs and their style.
- What was their approach, goal, their philosophy in their type design?
- Their web site and social media handles, if possible

You'll present these at the start of each class. We'll likely do two or three per week. They'll only be a few minutes each.

### Your Task

Create a single-page letter-sized bio in InDesign. The layout should be inspired by the typographer's typefaces. Other than that, the design is up to you. We'll share your document with the class so everyone has a bio of each typographer.

#### Write Your Own Text

This assignment requires that you write your own content. It is forbidden to copy text from the web or any other source. When doing one of these assignments. I suggest make your own notes in bullet list form based on your research. Once you've done your research you can re-write the text in your own words. Be sure there isn't even one sentence that is not your own.

No matter how good a writer you are, it's always a good idea to have someone else proof-read your text.

#### Avoid Reading

Once you have your page layout done, get familiar with the content. When you present, avoid reading the text. Try to speak it in a more natural manner. Just talk to us about the individual while referring to the key points on your sheet.

You've got this!
