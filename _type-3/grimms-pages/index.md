This is all about finesse. The basics of this assignment are simple to execute. Achieving true harmony on the page is more challenging. The goal is to design an elegant, readable page with welcoming type, minimal hyphenation and subtle letter & word spacing.

### Real-World Context

In the real world, there may be many players involved in designing a book. You could be doing this as an in-house designer for a publishing company. In other circumstances, you could be working directly for the author.

Usually, the designer is provided a Word document with the manuscript. You would need to remove certain formatting from the Word document. It all depends on how it is produced. In this case, it's a good idea to work closely with the author so they format the text properly.

In our case, we need to remove double paragraph breaks from our text. We'll be using a Space After setting instead.

Before doing the layout for all the pages, we would supply a few representative pages to the client so they can sign-off on the design. That's what this project is going to be -- just those few pages.

The printer will guide you in the some technical requirements. IRL, you may need to build an [InDesign book file](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/creating-book-files.html).

### Anatomy of a Book

#### Front Matter

The front matter can include a protective page, a title page, a copyright page, dedications, an epigraph, the table of contents, a forward, acknowledgments, a prologue and more. It all depends on the context.

Front matter pages are traditionally paginated with roman numerals.

#### Content

The main part of the book made of the actual manuscript. It'll have regular pages and chapter pages. **This is what we're doing in this project.**

The content pages may contain ornaments. You can use an ornament from your font on chapter opening pages or for breaks in the text. *These should not be distracting.*

Pagination is in arabic numerals at the top-outside, bottom-center or bottom-outside of the page.

The content may include bold or italicized text, block quotes, drop caps, section breaks, running headers, folios, and more.

#### Back Matter

The back matter can include an index, a glossary, notes, acknowledgments, the author's bio, a list of books by the author and more.
