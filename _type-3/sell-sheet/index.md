It's a duplex letter page in full colour with bleeds whose purpose is to promote a company, state its purpose and give contact information. All the content, text, photos and logo are provided. You need to use it allâ€”no more, no less.

The design (layout, type, and colours) needs to reflect the tone and voice of the company. Construction of new roofs needs to communicate:

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>product reliability</li>
	<li>service reliability</li>
	<li>compliance with building codes</li>
	<li>aesthetics</li>
</ul>

The clientele for this company varies broadly. They sell to adult home-owners.
