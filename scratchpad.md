## Fluid Type Scales

Rather than using arbitrary numerical type break points, fluid type generators work with steps.

This is a really good explanation of the [evolution of the grid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/) from the page to screens.

- [Smashing Magazine on Fluid Type Systems](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/)
- [Utopia Fluid Type Generator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/)
- [Google's layout guidelines](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#principles)

Google developers use [*density-independant pixels*](https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html#density-independence) as a unit of measure. It's abbreviated as *dp* and pronounced *dips*.

Smashing Magazine [article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/building-better-ui-designs-layout-grids/) on layout grids for different screen sizes.

Another [good article](https://medium.muz.li/responsive-grid-design-ultimate-guide-7aa41ca7892) about layout grids for screens.

[Google's type info](https://material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html#type-properties) Interesting info on aligning to the baseline grid on the screen.
