## Deliverables

You're going to submit your files for production as shown below. As it suggests, each Illustrator file in the production folder has its own colour version.

You can find Pantone numbers on this [process colours to Pantone web site](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/cmyk_to_pantone.php){:target="_blank"}.

The PDF file is a contact sheet with the wordmark in each colour with its recipe. Make it look tidy to present to the client.
