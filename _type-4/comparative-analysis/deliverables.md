### Prepare Print-Ready Files

All the assignments you submit in Typography courses should be print ready. This is what you have to check before packaging your files.

#### File Organization

As you work, keep your files organized in a project folder. You should have your main page-layout file.

#### RGB Colour

When the project calls for RGB colour, there should be no spot colours in any of the files you submit. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.

#### Font files

As we'll only be using Adobe Fonts, there's not much to do here. No fonts will ever be packaged with your projects, so you have nothing to worry about. Be sure to check <span class="command">Type > Find Fonts...</span> to ensure only the fonts you're using are in your document.

If there's a font folder in your package folder, there's a problem. Look inside to see what's there. It's not an Adobe Font, so you need to go remove it from your InDesign file, then package it again.

### Your Submission Folder

Be sure your InDesign document is named as usual:

**appleseed-johnny-010-comparative-analysis.indd**

Never rename a file while it's open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.

When you package your InDesign document with <span class="command">File > Package...</span> It will create a folder that's properly named if your file was well named to start with.

![Full InDesign package]({{site.url}}/svg/submission-indesign-package.svg){:width="50%"}

### PDF Setup

Open your PDF in Adobe Acrobat. Hit <span class="command">âŒ˜-d</span>. Choose these settings:

| Layout and Magnification |                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Navigation tab:          | Pages Panel and Page |
| Page layout:             | Single Page          |
| Magnification:           | Fit Page             |
| Open to page:            | 1                    |

Save, then close your PDF file. Zip, then submit the whole InDesign package folder.
