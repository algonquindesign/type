Starting with the page as our canvas, we'll learn how to design a layout grid. We'll take the whole page's dimensions as foundational dimensions on which we'll devise margins, columns and a baseline grid. The whole system will be built to accommodate a hierarchical type system.

### Why a Baseline Grid?

Aligning text to the baseline grid creates a structured and clean look with a vertical rhythm on the page.

![Baseline Grids]({{site.url}}/svg/baseline-grids/baseline-grids.svg){:width="90%"}

An additional challenge is working with different size type which all aligns to the baseline grid.
