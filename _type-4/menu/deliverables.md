### Prepare Print-Ready Files

All the assignments you submit in Typography courses should be print ready. The following is what you have to check before packaging your files.

#### File Organization

As you work, keep your files organized in a project folder. You should have your main page-layout file.

> You will always simply submit a packaged folder including a PDF file for all assignments.

#### Process Colour

When the project calls for process colour (or four colour process), there should be no spot colours in any of the files you submit. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.

If you have photos in RGB, open them in Photoshop. Go to <span style="command">Edit > Convert to Profile...</span> Make sure the Destination Space Profile is set to <span style="command">Working CMYK</span>.

#### Font files

As we'll only be using Adobe Fonts, there's not much to do here. No fonts will ever be packaged with your projects, so you have nothing to worry about. Be sure to check <span class="command">Type > Find Fonts...</span> to ensure only the fonts you're using are indeed Adobe Fonts.

If there's a font folder in your package folder, there's a problem. Look inside to see what's there. It's not an Adobe Font, so you need to go remove it from your InDesign file, then package it again.

### Digital Submission

Be sure your InDesign document is named as usual:

**appleseed-johnny-010-menu.indd**

> Never rename a file while it's open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.

When you package your InDesign document with <span class="command">File > Package...</span> It will create a folder that's properly named if your file was well named to start with.

Your PDF file needs to have 9 point bleeds with crop marks.

### Print Submission

#### Option One: Content Proofs

Content proofs are colour outputs of your work. There is no binding involved. If your work is two-sided, then that's the way you should print it. You do not need to trim it down.

If the dimensions are greater than tabloid, 11" Ã— 17", you'll have to print this at the college's Print Shop or at your local print shop.

This is a sample name label for your envelope.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Put your pages in an envelope with a proper label on it. It will be loose sheets, *not mounted*. Do not fold them. If you need to purchase an over-sized envelope, please do so.

#### Option Two: Full Mockup

If you wish to add this piece to your portfolio, you can create a full mockup of your menu with the binding you chose. What you submit will depend on the format of your menu. It should look like the final menu the restaurant would use in real life.
