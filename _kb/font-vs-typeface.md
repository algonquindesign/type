deck: "What's the difference between a font and a typeface? Is it really that important?"

For the longest time, designers have gritted their teeth when someone mis-uses type terminology. The most common case is *font* versus *typeface*. The fact is, there are actually different acceptable definitions.

Generally, when we use typeface, we're referring to the appearance of the the glyphsâ€”their design. When we use font, we're talking about the file on the computer. So, *I design typefaces*, but *I activate fonts on my computer*.

Others also use *font* for what I call an *instance*. Garamond Italic is what I call an instance in the Garamond family. Some people call that *a font*.

I sometimes catch myself misusing the terms. It's mostly because font is such a short word. Typeface seems a bit laboursome and formal in the spoken word.
