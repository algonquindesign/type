A type waterfall displays all the variants within a family. Below, we see a waterfall for the *Warnock* family. There are actually many more instances than this.

Below is a waterfall of the *Acumin* family, which is really large. There are too many variants to show them all in a sentence. This layout for a waterfall is a variation of one which was originally designed by Adrian Frutiger, for [his typeface *Univers*](https://imjustcreative.com/univers-type-specimen-sheets/2020/01/21){:target="_blank"}.
