Each glyph in a monospace font occupies the same amount of space, regardless of its width. A wider glyph, like an *m* will be designed to be narrower. A narrow glyph like an *i* is designed to be wide. If you put each glyph in a square, including its surrounding space, each square would be the same width.

Monospace typefaces originated on typewriters. Each time one typed a letter, the carriage would move forward by the same distance, whether you typed the letter *i* or the letter *w*. <span style="font-family: 'Courier';">Courier is the definitive monospaced face</span>. It was commissioned by IBM in the 1950's for its typewriters.

Monospace faces are often perceived as low-tech, related to typewriters or computer programming. They are used there, but they can also be useful when you want your design to look un-designed. ðŸ˜¬

They're ideal for setting tabular figures in financial documents or anything with columns of numbers.

Adobe Fonts has [a whole search category](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts?browse_mode=default&filters=cl:ms&max_styles=26&min_styles=1) dedicated to them.

#### Fun Fact

The American Typewriter family was designed to mimmic monotype faces while actually being a *proportional* type design.

The family is reminiscent of an old typewriter font. It's just beautifully designed.

#### What to Avoid

It's really not a good idea to set monospace type for long amounts of text. It takes up a lot of space on the page. It's hard to read. Use proportional faces instead.
