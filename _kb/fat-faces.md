What is a fat face typeface? Imagine Bodoni gorged itself on donuts and candy for a month. A fat face typeface is simply an ultra-bold typeface, often with extreme thick-thin contrast. They were first used in the 1800s by British typographers on bills (or posters). At the start, they were often set in all caps. With time, italics and [shaded](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/ingeborg) versions gained popularity.

Some consider these slab serif typefaces. It depends on the design of the individual typeface.

Today, there are [digital revivals](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/wtr-fatboy) of classic fat face designs.
