There are many criteria to consider when selecting a typeface for your design projects. One of them is whether a type family contains proper quote marks and prime marks in their complement of glyphs.

Unfortunately, a lot of type heritage on computers is from typewriters, which could only type a finite number of glyphs. It was a mechanical limitation of all typewriters.

### Double Quote Marks

Avoid using prime marks, or *dumb quote marks* to quote text. Use proper double curly quotes instead. Quote marks *should not* be used for emphasis.

![Double Quote Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-double-quotes-marks.svg){:width="90%"}

![Double Quote Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-double-quotes-marks-large.svg){:width="50%"}

What's shown above are proper double curly quote marks.

### Single Quote Marks

Single quote marks are used for a quote inside another quote. They should also be curly or curved.

![Single Quote Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-single-quotes-marks.svg){:width="90%"}

![Single Quote Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-single-quotes-marks-large.svg){:width="50%"}

What's shown above are proper single curly quote marks.

### Apostrophe

The apostrophe is used for contractions, like *can't*. It's a also used to indicate the possessive case of nouns, like *the boy's bicycle*. It can also mark plurals, as in *watch your p's and q's* and *the 1950's*.

The apostrophe should also be curly. It's the same glyph as the single closing quote mark.

![Apostrophe Glyph]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-apostrophe.svg){:width="90%"}

![Apostrophe Glyph]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-apostrophe-large.svg){:width="50%"}

Interestingly, in the typeface [Tisa](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/ff-tisa) by FontFont, the typographer designed a distinct apostrophe glyph.

![Proper Apostrophe Glyph, Tisa typeface]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-quote-vs-apostrophe.svg){:width="90%"}

![Proper Apostrophe Glyph, Tisa typeface]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-quote-vs-apostrophe-large.svg){:width="50%"}

Note how the apostrophe sits lower, near the x-height. The single closing quote is at the cap height. This is very unusual, but a welcome addition.

### Prime Marks

Prime marks are used in a mathematical context, as shown below. They're sometimes called *dumb quotes* or *tick marks*. They're properly called *primes*.

![Prime Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-prime.svg){:width="90%"}

![Prime Marks]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/quotes-prime-large.svg){:width="50%"}

Avoid using these marks to quote text, unless you have no choice. Note that many monospace typefaces have no proper curly quote marks because of their provenance on the typewriter.
