If you're having trouble finding two typefaces that really go well together, there are type designs which include multiple styles based on the same design.

As you can see below, we have examples of type designs in multiple categories, serifs, sans and slabs.

![Serifs, Sans & Slabs]({{site.url}}/svg/kb/serifs-sans-slabs.svg){:width="90%"}
The families are [Museo](https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=museo), [Corporate](https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=corporate), [Adelle](https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=adelle) and [Skolar](https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=skolar). There are more of these on Adobe Fonts. One easy way to find them is to do a search with the word `sans`. Often, when a typeface has the word sans in the name, there's a serif design to complement it.

When you use these, you can be sure that they work well together because they were designed that way.
