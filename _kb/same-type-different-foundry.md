> A type foundry is a company that designs or distributes typefaces. Before digital typography, type foundries manufactured and sold metal and wood typefaces for hand typesetting, and matrices for line-casting machines like the Linotype and Monotype, for letterpress printers. Today's digital type foundries accumulate and distribute typefaces (typically as digitized fonts) created by type designers, who may either be freelancers operating their own independent foundry, or employed by a foundry. Type foundries may also provide custom type design services.

The term *foundry* comes from the French *Fonderie*, which has *fondre* as its root. *Fondre* means *to melt* in French.

Foundries also commission new versions of existing typefaces. See the example of Futura by both ParaType and by Adobe Systems. The first thing is that PT is set much larger and slightly heavier. I had to reduce from 64 points to 60 points for their sizes to (almost) match! Otherwise, the descenders on PT are shorter. The spine of the **s** are bent sharper on PT than Adobe's. There are other very subtle differences.

You can see some of the quite drastic and some subtle differences in the individual glyphs from different foundries.
