deck: "In typography, optical designs are instances within a family which are specially designed to be set at determined sizes."

Typefaces which include such variants have subtle design adjustments meant to serve specific type sizes. These adjustments were always built into metal type. They were lost for a time, with digital type. If optical variants don't exist in your chosen typeface, some detail may be lost if it's set small. Similarly, they may sacrifice subtlety at larger sizes.

The type above is all set at the same size to illustrate how Caption, the smallest, is set more open compared to Display, which is set tighter. Caption is also bolder and Display lighter in weight.

The adjustments typically made to the design to optimize it for different sizes are: for larger point sizes, the space between characters tightens, the space within characters closes up, the serifs become finer and the stroke contrast becomes greater. The x-height gradually diminishes. For smaller point sizes, opposite adjustments are made.

The point sizes below are merely a guideline. Use your judgement based on the specific type family in your design. Test your design by either printing it or viewing it on many different screens.
