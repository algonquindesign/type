The overshoot is what it says it is. It's the part of the letter that overshoots the baseline or the cap line to make the glyph size look *optically* correct.

As you can see in the bottom example, when I scaled the type to remove the overshoots, the size looks wrong. They're mathematically the same height as the other letters but optically, they look smaller.
