[The manicule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicule){:target="_blank"} originates from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts to bring attention to something in the text from the margins. Today, it's just another dingbat in a world replete with them.

It is often used as a simple page decoration or a bullet glyph. Sadly, it is sometimes used as a computer cursor in poorly designed user interfaces, such as in Adobe Acrobat.

You can easily use the manicule on your mobile device as an emoji. <span style="font-size: 2rem;">👈🏼</span>
