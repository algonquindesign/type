Slanted, sloped or oblique type usually refers to sans-serif type which is leaning over. We commonly call it italic but a true italic is usually a serif. The glyphs have completely different designs than their roman counterparts. They have a more calligraphic appearance.

Hopefully the sans-serif type you use has an oblique instance. Avoid using *faux-oblique*. That's when you use the button in the software to make the type lean over when there isn't an oblique instance of the font.

Italics also often have smaller character width. They save space. That was their original purpose.

In modern writing, italics are used for emphasis, citing in foreign languages or quoting a speaker.
