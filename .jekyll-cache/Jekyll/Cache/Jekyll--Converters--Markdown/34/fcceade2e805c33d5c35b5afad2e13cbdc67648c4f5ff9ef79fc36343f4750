<p>Below is a waterfall of the <em>Acumin</em> family, which is really large. There are too many variants to show them all in a sentence. This layout for a waterfall is a variation of one which was originally designed by Adrian Frutiger, for <a href="https://imjustcreative.com/univers-type-specimen-sheets/2020/01/21" target="_blank">his typeface <em>Univers</em></a>.</p>
