I"¨<p>Each glyph in a monospace font occupies the same amount of space, regardless of its width. A wider glyph, like an <em>m</em> will be designed to be narrower. A narrow glyph like an <em>i</em> is designed to be wide. If you put each glyph in a square, including its surrounding space, each square would be the same width.</p>

<p>Monospace typefaces originated on typewriters. Each time one typed a letter, the carriage would move forward by the same distance, whether you typed the letter <em>i</em> or the letter <em>w</em>. <span style="font-family: 'Courier';">Courier is the definitive monospaced face</span>. It was commissioned by IBM in the 1950â€™s for its typewriters.</p>

<p>Monospace faces are often perceived as low-tech, related to typewriters or computer programming. They are used there, but they can also be useful when you want your design to look un-designed. ðŸ˜¬</p>

<p>Theyâ€™re ideal for setting tabular figures in financial documents or anything with columns of numbers.</p>

<p>The American Typewriter family was designed to mimmic monotype faces while actually being a <em>proportional</em> type design.</p>

<p>The family is reminiscent of an old typewriter font. Itâ€™s just beautifully designed.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really not a good idea to set monospace type for long amounts of text. It takes up a lot of space on the page. Itâ€™s hard to read. Use proportional faces instead.</p>
