I"ö<p>You will design a restaurant menu with type, raster and vector graphics using provided content. The goal of this assignment is to capture the essence of the style of the establishment, then to express it in a type-based design. Your pages should ease dinersâ€™ meal selection and make them feel welcome. This will increase sales for your client, the restaurant owner. See? Now everyone is well fed and happy!</p>

<p>This is your opportunity to use more than serif and sans-serif typefaces. A display face can be of use for section titles and to call attention to specials. Use display faces judiciously. Usually one well-chosen face will do the trick.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll can also create raster of vector graphics. Do not distract your diners! Too many graphics will overload the page and hinder decision-making.</p>
