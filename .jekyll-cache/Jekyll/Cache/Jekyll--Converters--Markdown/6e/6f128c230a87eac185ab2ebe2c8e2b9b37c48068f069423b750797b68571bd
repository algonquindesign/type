I")<p>For this project, there are no specific limits on the use of type except for your judgement of what’s appropriate for the client. You should be applying the rules you’ve learned to date. Of course, you must only be choosing from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Type</a>.</p>

<h3 id="display-typefaces">Display Typefaces</h3>

<p>The style of your chosen restaurant will dictate your type selection. Some type designs are closely related to certain cultures, but we must avoid stereotypes. Typefaces which mimics a foreign language can be offensive.</p>

<p>Many display faces have only one instance. If you can find a family with multiple instances, it will give you that much more flexibility.</p>

<h3 id="serif--sans-serif">Serif &amp; Sans-Serif</h3>

<p>You have the choice of working with a serif and a sans, or both, in addition to your display face. As usual, you’ll need to make a sound pairing with them all.</p>

<h3 id="elements-of-a-menu-design">Elements of a Menu Design</h3>

<p>The <em>minimum</em> elements of your menu design will include</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Restaurant Name</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li class="second">section titles</li>
	<li class="second">item names</li>
	<li class="second">item descriptions</li>
	<li class="second">item prices</li>
	<li class="second">item modifiers</li>
	<li class="second">ingredient statements (vegan, nuts, etc…)</li>
	<li class="second">call-outs for specials</li>
	<li class="second">contact information</li>
	<li class="second">social media links</li>
	<li class="second"><a href="https://svgqrcodes.com/?lang=en" title="QR Code Generator" target="_blank">QR code</a> to restaurant web site</li>
</ul>

<p>You can move these items around to suit your design.</p>

<h3 id="technical-considerations">Technical Considerations</h3>

<p>While working in InDesign, we want to put into practice what you’ve learned to date.</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Use as few InDesign text frames as possible</li>
	<li>Use paragraph styles throughout</li>
	<li>Use a tab character rather than multiple spaces.</li>
	<li>You should not have more than one consecutive paragraph break.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clean-up-the-content">Clean Up the Content</h3>

<p>The text for your menu is going to need some cleaning up. You’ll remove multiple paragraph breaks. Some of the menu items are in upper case letters. That’ll need to change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let InDesign do most of this work. Type in the text the very least possible, if at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="grep-patterns">GREP Patterns</h4>

<p>InDesign’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edit &gt; Find/Change…</code> command is going to be your friend here. Use it wisely and attentively.</p>

<p>This is a little primer on GREP (or regex) patterns. You can use these in the Find/Change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd-f</code> dialogue in InDesign. Be sure to click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GREP</code> tab in the Find/Change dialogue.</p>

<p>You can find a price like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$12</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\$\d+</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\$</code> finds a dollar sign. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d+</code> finds one or more digits.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/README.md#2-meta-characters" target="_blank">this table</a> for the definitions of more <em>meta characters</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more about GREP patterns, these sites will get you going. <a href="https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/README.md">Learn REGEX The Easy Way</a> and <a href="https://regexr.com">Regexer</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/find-change.html">Adobe Support doc</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Type &gt; Change Case…</code>. If you’re using small caps, you can set that in your paragraph styles.</p>
