I"ñ<p>What is a fat face typeface? Imagine Bodoni gorged itself on donuts and candy for a month. A fat face typeface is simply an ultra-bold typeface, often with extreme thick-thin contrast. They were first used in the 1800s by British typographers on bills (or posters). At the start, they were often set in all caps. With time, italics and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/ingeborg">shaded</a> versions gained popularity.</p>

<p>Some consider these slab serif typefaces. It depends on the design of the individual typeface.</p>
