<p>Before its use on the internet for e-mail addresses and use handles, the symbol was used to mean a rate. ie: <em>I purchased 3kg of beef @ $2/kg</em>. Before that, one of the first uses was as a symbol for the <em>arroba</em> in Spain and Portugal. It was a unit of weight of about 12kg.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not like the ampersand, where it says <em>and</em> but has the name <em>ampersand</em>. The @ symbol is pronounced <em>at</em> and is called <em>at</em>.</p>
