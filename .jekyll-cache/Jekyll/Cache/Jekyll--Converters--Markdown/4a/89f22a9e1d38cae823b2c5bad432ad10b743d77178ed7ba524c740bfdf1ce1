I"Æ<p>To date, weâ€™ve designed informal grids which lend themselves to single pages of content. We then designed single-column grids which are commonly found in fiction novels. Now, weâ€™ll step up once again to the modular grid. This is the most flexible type of grid. It allows for placement of text and other types of content like images, tables of data, graphics and more.</p>

<p>With increased flexibility comes increased complexity. Weâ€™ll be juggling with more balls at a time, so itâ€™s easier to drop one. Thatâ€™s why we need to be methodical in our process.</p>

  <dt>Content Inventory</dt>
  <dd>As a cook needs to know what ingredients they have at their disposal, we need to inventory our content.</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li class="second">Read all the text to become familiar with the content.</li>
	<li class="second">Check for typos or grammatical errors.</li>
	<li class="second">Are there lists, tables and/or other types of content?</li>
	<li class="second">Open all the images to check pixel dimensions, colour mode, image quality.</li>
</ul>

  <dt>Grid Design</dt>
  <dd>Now that weâ€™re familiar with our content, we can design our page grid. This stage also includes sketching layouts based on the provided content.</dd>
  <dt>Type Selection</dt>
  <dd>As always, we need to choose typefaces. Here, youâ€™re permitted two families plus an optional display/dingbat typeface. In the real world, these are the families that would be used on an on-going basis for this publication.</dd>
  <dt>Type Hierarchy</dt>
  <dd>Establish the hierarchy based on our selected type families and the provided content. You can work with family, size, case, weight, width, colour, italics and more.</dd>
  <dt>Page Element Design</dt>
  <dd>Design functional and decorative elements like folios, background shapes and colours, photo treatments, etcâ€¦</dd>
  <dt>Colour Selection</dt>
  <dd>Select two colours. One should be a <em>feature</em> colour whose properties are brighter and more saturated. This one is used to grab the readerâ€™s attention. The second colour can be more muted and generally <em>quieter</em>. This one is used when you want something to be non-black, but it doesnâ€™t need to scream at the reader. You also have access to these two coloursâ€™ tints and shades. Create a palette of swatches that youâ€™ll actually use in your layout. The more restricted it is, the more punch your design will have.</dd>
  <dt>Page Construction</dt>
  <dd>The final step is to build the actual pages in InDesign. As always, this stage is more technical than creative. Use all the software tools you know to build this to be easily editable. Weâ€™re talking text styles, image styles, table styles, Parent Pages and all that good stuff.</dd>
