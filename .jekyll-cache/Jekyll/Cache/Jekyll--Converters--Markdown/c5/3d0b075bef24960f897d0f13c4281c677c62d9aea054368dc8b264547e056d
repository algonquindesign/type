<p>Typographers actually design typefaces. The start with a purpose or reason for a type design. What problem does it solve? What use-case hasnâ€™t been solved that this design will satisfy? Is the type meant for long text or headlines? Is it to mimic a old typewriter or a broad-tipped pen?</p>

<p>Typographers can sell their work in different ways. They can be independant, selling their type directly to the end-user, either through their own stores or through online distributors.</p>

<p>Large corporations often hire typographers to create bespoke type for their brands, too.</p>

<h4 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h4>

<p>Type cannot be designed ignoring the centuries of typographic history. Thereâ€™s a historical context that needs to be considered. In which category will the design belong â€“ old style, modern, slab, sans?</p>

<h4 id="the-nitty-gritty">The Nitty Gritty</h4>

<p>Typographers, like all designers, start with sketching individual glyphs and their stand-out features. There are certain letters which lend themselves as good starting points like the <strong>s</strong> and the <strong>n</strong>. There are words like <strong>Handgloves</strong> which contain letters which represent a wide range of typographic features, like ascenders, descenders, overshoots, etcâ€¦</p>

<h4 id="type-design-software">Type Design Software</h4>

<p>Once the designer has reached the limit of sketching, there are font design apps like <a href="https://glyphsapp.com">Glyphs</a> and <a href="https://www.fontlab.com">FontLab</a>. There are others. This is where all the fine details can be implemented.</p>

<p>When designing a typeface, there are other considerations beyond the glyphs. Thereâ€™s side-bearing and kerning. There are alternate glyphs, swashes, <a href="https://www.type-together.com/understanding-diacritics">diacritics</a> and more.</p>

<p>There are typefaces created for corporate use and some for general sale.</p>

<h4 id="licensing">Licensing</h4>

<p>Itâ€™s complicated.</p>

<p>There are two perspectives to consider. The owner of the copyrighted material and the user. You can <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/font-licensing">read more about it here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="design-quality">Design Quality</h4>

<p>There <em>are</em> poor quality and superior quality designs, as in everything. Designing typefaces is incredibly detailed, painstaking work. Neglecting such details can lead to a typeface that is missing needed features or lacks finesse. That said, there may be a place for such type. It all depends on context.</p>

<h3 id="foundries">Foundries</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term <em>foundry</em> comes from the French <em>fondre</em>, which means to melt. The original foundries melted metal to pour it into a mold to create metal type.</p>
