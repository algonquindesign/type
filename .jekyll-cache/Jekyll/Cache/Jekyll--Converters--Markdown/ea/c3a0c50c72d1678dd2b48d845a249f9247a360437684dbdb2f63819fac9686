I"¹<p>Your wordmark needs to be a highly conceptual, type-only design.</p>

<p>Since a wordmark is heavily reliant on type, it is important that you select or create typography that is appropriate to the tone of the brandâ€”think elegant or traditional or fun or minimal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your basic design will be based on a typeface. The concept will come from customization of the type.</p>

<p>Your final wordmark needs to be:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Memorable</dt>
  <dd>Much like a song, your wordmark needs a clever hookâ€”that thing that makes other designers think <em>Darn, I wish I had thought of that!</em></dd>
  <dt>Versatile</dt>
  <dd>It needs to be easy to depict across media. It should be just as distinct on a small screen, on apparel, stationery, etcâ€¦ Avoid very thin stroke weights. They donâ€™t scale down well. The concept must not depend on the colours. That means that the mark works in a single colour.</dd>
  <dt>Accessible</dt>
  <dd>The mark needs to be very legible. Elements cannot be obstructed by a contrived design trying too hard to integrate a visual. Contrast needs to be great enough so even those with vision challenges can discern your wordmark.</dd>
