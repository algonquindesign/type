I"Ü<p>Faux small caps happen when we scale down a capital letter to the same x-height as a lower case letter. What happens here is that the weight of the glyph gets scaled down too much compared to the lower-case letter next to it.</p>

<p>When a font doesnâ€™t contain a small cap, some page layout software scales down the glyph. This causes a faux small cap.</p>

<p>Note that small caps are sometimes slightly larger than the x-height of the lower case glyphs. There are also <strong>petite caps</strong>, which are exactly the same x-height as the lower case glyphs.</p>

<p>Either way, it is generally frowned upon to scale a letter within a word. The weights of each character are affected. It just looks bad.</p>

<p>You should be able to see the difference between real small caps and faked ones. If youâ€™re concerned you canâ€™t, simply consult the Glyphs panel to see if theyâ€™re there.</p>

<p>In the example above you can see how the weight of the capital compared to the rest of the phrase is incorrect in the lower example. Itâ€™s a fairly subtle difference, but itâ€™s there.</p>

<p>If you wish to use small caps in a web page youâ€™re designing, youâ€™ll need to invoke them in a specific way.</p>

<p>One would think that using <span class="command">font-variant: small-caps</span> would do the trick in all circumstances. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t always work. All this is going to do is have the browser render faux small caps, if they arenâ€™t available in the typeface design.</p>

<div style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 2.5rem; font-variant: small-caps;">This is in faux small caps.</div>

<div style="font-family: FiraSans-Regular; font-size: 2.5rem; font-variant: small-caps;">This is in real small caps.</div>

<p>You need to make sure your typeface includes small caps the same way you do in InDesign.</p>
