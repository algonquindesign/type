<p>Prepare a short presentation about your given typographer. You only need to present what’s on your bio about them. Just be ready to speak clearly. Present the facts in an orderly fashion so the class can share in the knowledge you’ve gained about them.</p>

<p>This is best done in InDesign. When you’re done, simply make sure the linked images are all in good order. You can see that in your Links panel.</p>

<p>Name your file:</p>

<p><span class="bold">last-name-first-name-group#-typographer.indd</span></p>

<p>Run <span class="command">File &gt; Package…</span>. You should always take a final look at the submission folder to make sure everything is where it should be.</p>

<p>Your package will be named the same way.</p>

<p><span class="bold">appleseed-johnny-010-typographer</span></p>

<p>Zip that folder, then submit on Brightspace.</p>
