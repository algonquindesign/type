<p>Once weâ€™ve done our exploration of <a href="/kb/classification-categories.html">type classifications</a>, the ballâ€™s going to be in your court. Pour through type families that are representative of a given era or classification.</p>

<p><strong>Choose a family that is a mainstay of that particular classification.</strong> Avoid minor, little-known typefaces.</p>

<p>Tell me the reason for your choice. No B.S. Make it honest. Take your time. What is it that appealed to you about this family? Donâ€™t worry, it doesnâ€™t need to be some deep historical thing, though it <em>can</em> be.</p>

<p>Do your research. Make your choice, then tell me.</p>

<h4 id="colour-treatment">Colour Treatment</h4>

<p>The fewer colours you use, the more focused your design will be. You <em>could</em> design this in a single colour with its tints and shades, or one colour plus black. If you choose two colours, the first should be a prominent colour. The second can be <em>quieter</em>. Too many colours will distract from the subject of the poster, the type design.</p>

<h4 id="production-specifications">Production Specifications</h4>

<p>These are pretty simple.</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Dimensions: 12" &#x00D7; 18" plus â…›" bleed</li>
	<li>Colour: Four Colour Process (full colour)</li>
	<li>Illustrator is your tool of choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-include">What to Include</h3>

<p>You will include the following on your poster. These are <em>minimum</em> requirements. You can include more if you come across it during your research.</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Typeface name</li>
	<li>Typographer's name</li>
	<li>Year of typeface design</li>
	<li>The classification category to which it belongs</li>
	<li>A <a href="/kb/type-waterfall.html" title="Type Waterfall">waterfall of the instances</a> that make up the family</li>
	<li>A block of paragraph text that describes the family</li>
	<li>A bio of the typographer in a block of paragraph text</li>
	<li>Prominent display of stand-out glyphs from the family</li>
	<li>Any other useful information you may find</li>
</ul>

<p>No photos are allowed on your poster. You can use lines, shapes and patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid a copy/paste from a web site. What I propose is that you read about the typeface and its designer. Take notes in your own words. Use those words on your poster.</p>

<p>Be sure the content is properly written and error-free.</p>
