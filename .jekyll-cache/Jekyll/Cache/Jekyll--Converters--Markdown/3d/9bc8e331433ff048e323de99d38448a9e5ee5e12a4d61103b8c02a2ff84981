I"â<p>The overshoot is what it says it is. Itâ€™s the part of the letter that overshoots the baseline or the cap line to make the glyph size look <em>optically</em> correct.</p>

<p>As you can see in the bottom example, when I scaled the type to remove the overshoots, the size looks wrong. Theyâ€™re mathematically the same height as the other letters but optically, they look smaller.</p>
