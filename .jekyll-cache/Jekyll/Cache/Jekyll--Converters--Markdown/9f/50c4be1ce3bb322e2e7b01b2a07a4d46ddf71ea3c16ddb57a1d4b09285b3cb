I"…<p>Screens have an actual grid of pixels. Thatâ€™s really ideal when all the content on the screen is made of horizontal and vertical lines. What happens when a line is angled or curved? Those lines will look all jaggy as theyâ€™re depicted with those square pixels.</p>

<p>Enter anti-aliasing. This is the feature which adds grey pixels along those edges to make them appear smooth.</p>

<p>As screens gain increasingly high resolution, these pixels get smaller and smaller. That just means that these pixels are so small the eye cannot differentiate them with the device at a normal reading distance.</p>

<p>In your day-to-day life as a designer, you donâ€™t need to worry about anti-aliasing too much. You donâ€™t need to be concerned with it when creating vector graphics. Only low-resolution raster images are a concernâ€”especially those with type in them.</p>

<p>In Photoshop, you can choose from various anti-aliasing settings while using the Type tool. Again, if youâ€™re exporting as SVG, these are irrelevant. If youâ€™re exporting for high-resolution displays, theyâ€™re irrelevant.</p>

<p>This is how Adobe describes the above settings.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>None</dt>
		<dd>Applies no anti-aliasing</dd>

	<dt>Sharp</dt>
		<dd>Type appears at its sharpest</dd>

	<dt>Crisp</dt>
		<dd>Type appears somewhat sharp</dd>

	<dt>Strong</dt>
		<dd>Type appears heavier</dd>

	<dt>Smooth</dt>
		<dd>Type appears smoother</dd>
</dl>
