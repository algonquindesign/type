I"E<p>For the longest time, designers have gritted their teeth when someone mis-uses type terminology. The most common case is <em>font</em> versus <em>typeface</em>. The fact is, there are actually different acceptable definitions.</p>

<p>Generally, when we use typeface, we’re referring to the appearance of the the glyphs—their design. When we use font, we’re talking about the file on the computer. So, <em>I design typefaces</em>, but <em>I activate fonts on my computer</em>.</p>

<p>Others also use <em>font</em> for what I call an <em>instance</em>. Garamond Italic is what I call an instance in the Garamond family. Some people call that <em>a font</em>.</p>

<p>I sometimes catch myself misusing the terms. It’s mostly because font is such a short word. Typeface seems a bit laboursome and formal in the spoken word.</p>
