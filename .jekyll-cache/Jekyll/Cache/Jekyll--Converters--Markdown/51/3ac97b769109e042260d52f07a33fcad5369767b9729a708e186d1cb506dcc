<p><a href="https://www.curiobarsf.com" target="_blank">Web Site</a>—A <em>curio</em> is an unusual, rare, or intriguing object. Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, Curio is at the center of the community, reflecting the free-spirited, artistic culture that defines this neighbourhood. From the design to the drinks and food, there is a unconventional style that reflects the vibe of the people who make up the bohemian community. Drawing inspiration from The Chapel’s past life as a mortuary, we explore the mystical, curious elements of life and time. Art installations include a multiplicity of clocks, victorian dioramas, vintage light fixtures, figurative paintings, and electric neon signs, creating an eclectic and mystical vibe throughout the variety of spaces.</p>
