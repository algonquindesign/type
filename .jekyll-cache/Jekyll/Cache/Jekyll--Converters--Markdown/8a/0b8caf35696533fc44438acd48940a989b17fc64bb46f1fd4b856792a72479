<h3 id="vectors">Vectors</h3>

<p>These are items to consider while building your wordmark.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/wordmark/type-size-difference.svg" alt="Exaggerated type size difference" width="30%" /></p>

<p>Avoid extreme type size differences. In the Avilion wordmark above, when we make the <em>Avilion</em> the right size, the <em>resort &amp; spa</em> end up too small</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/wordmark/thick-thin-stroke.svg" alt="Thick-thin strokes" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Avoid overly-thin strokes and thick/thin contrast. They don’t scale down well.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/wordmark/expand-art.svg" alt="Expand your artwork" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Once you’ve completed your design, you want to keep a <em>live</em> version of the artwork. That means that the type is <strong>not</strong> outlined.</p>

<p>In a duplicate file, you need to use the <span class="command">Object &gt; Expand Appearance</span> and the <span class="command">Object &gt; Expand…</span> commands then simplify the rest of your artwork. Leave no live strokes.</p>

<h3 id="colour">Colour</h3>

<p>You need to deliver a version of the logo art in each colour, black, greyscale, spot colours (Pantone), for the screen (RGB), and process colours (CMYK).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/wordmark/wordmark-colours.svg" alt="Colour Spaces" width="90%" /></p>

<p>When you set your greys in the greyscale files, you can use <span class="command">Edit &gt; Edit Colours &gt; Convert to Greyscale</span>. Don’t stop there. Set the value of the greys to percentages of black (k) only. Be sure there’s enough difference between the two. Also, the lightest grey needs to be dark enough for someone with vision challenges.</p>

<h3 id="file-formats">File Formats</h3>

<p>Before we begin work, we need to question our client about which deliverables they’re going to need. Giving them vector files is obvious and simple. We need to ask them about which raster versions of the wordmark they’re going to want to use upon delivery.</p>

<p>They may want to add it to their point-of-sale software, for example. This will require specific dimension. Get the specifications for all these applications before you start work. Include this file production in your pricing for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will NOT be submitting any raster formats for this assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you’re done, you can deliver the files in a well organized zip-compressed folder <a href="deliverables.html">as shown here</a>.</p>
