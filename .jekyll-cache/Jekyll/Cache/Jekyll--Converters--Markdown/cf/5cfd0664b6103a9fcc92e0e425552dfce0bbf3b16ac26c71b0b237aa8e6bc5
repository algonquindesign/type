I"î<p>This project is an analytical comparison of two type families which may appear to the layman to be very similar. The goal is to use your knowledge of the history and of the anatomy of type to recognize and identify similarities and differences in their characteristics. You will also compare the make-up of the families as a whole.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of slides in your presentation. Whatâ€™s more important is to include all the required elements of the comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No bullet lists are permitted in your layouts. Please find a more creative solution for laying out your content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create it in InDesign so you have superior typographic control. These are the settings to use in your document.</p>

<h3 id="stages-of-the-project">Stages of the Project</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Research origins and purpose of your typefaces. Keep notes in bullet-list form.</li>
  <li>Research typographers. Keep notes in bullet-list form.</li>
  <li>Choose a typeface for slide content.</li>
  <li>Design a layout &amp; style for parent pages (template pages).</li>
  <li>Choose colours for document.</li>
  <li>Compare and contrast both families. This is the central work for this project. Use Illustrator to compare and dissect glyphs, as I did on the Type web site.</li>
  <li>Organize information</li>
  <li>Build slides. Use Parent Pages, Paragraph Styles, etcâ€¦ Re-write text in your own words based on the bullet-lists youâ€™ve created.</li>
</ol>
