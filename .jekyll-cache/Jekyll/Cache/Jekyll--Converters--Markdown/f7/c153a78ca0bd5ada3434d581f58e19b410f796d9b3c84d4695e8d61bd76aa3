I"¯<p>Starting with the page as our canvas, weâ€™ll learn how to design a layout grid. Weâ€™ll take the whole pageâ€™s dimensions as foundational dimensions on which weâ€™ll devise margins, columns and a baseline grid. The whole system will be built to accommodate a hierarchical type system.</p>

<h3 id="why-a-baseline-grid">Why a Baseline Grid?</h3>

<p>Aligning text to the baseline grid creates a structured and clean look with a vertical rhythm on the page.</p>

<p>An additional challenge is working with different size type which all aligns to the baseline grid.</p>
