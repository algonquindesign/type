I"E<p>Slanted, sloped or oblique type usually refers to sans-serif type which is leaning over. We commonly call it italic but a true italic is usually a serif. The glyphs have completely different designs than their roman counterparts. They have a more calligraphic appearance.</p>

<p>Hopefully the sans-serif type you use has an oblique instance. Avoid using <em>faux-oblique</em>. That’s when you use the button in the software to make the type lean over when there isn’t an oblique instance of the font.</p>

<p>Italics also often have smaller character width. They save space. That was their original purpose.</p>

<p>In modern writing, italics are used for emphasis, citing in foreign languages or quoting a speaker.</p>
