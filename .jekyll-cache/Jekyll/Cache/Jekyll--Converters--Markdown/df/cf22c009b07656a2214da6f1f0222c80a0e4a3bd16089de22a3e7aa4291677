I"¢<p>Typefaces which include such variants have subtle design adjustments meant to serve specific type sizes. These adjustments were always built into metal type. They were lost for a time, with digital type. If optical variants donâ€™t exist in your chosen typeface, some detail may be lost if itâ€™s set small. Similarly, they may sacrifice subtlety at larger sizes.</p>

<figcaption>
The type above is all set at the same size to illustrate how Caption, the smallest, is set more open compared to Display, which is set tighter. Caption is also bolder and Display lighter in weight.

<p>The adjustments typically made to the design to optimize it for different sizes are: for larger point sizes, the space between characters tightens, the space within characters closes up, the serifs become finer and the stroke contrast becomes greater. The x-height gradually diminishes. For smaller point sizes, opposite adjustments are made.</p>

<p>The point sizes below are merely a guideline. Use your judgement based on the specific type family in your design. Test your design by either printing it or viewing it on many different screens.</p>

<h2 id="variant-names">Variant Names</h2>

<p>There are many names for optical variants. This is not an exhaustive list. It does include common ones.</p>

<h4 id="caption">Caption</h4>

<p>Typefaces with <em>Caption</em> in their names are designed to be set at small sizes of approximately 6 to 8 points.</p>

<h4 id="text">Text</h4>

<p>Typefaces with <em>Text</em> in their names are designed to be used for body copy, set at approximately 9 to 12 points.</p>

<h4 id="subhead">Subhead</h4>

<p>Typefaces with <em>Subhead</em> in their names are designed to be set at larger than text sizes from 14 to 20 points.</p>

<h4 id="display">Display</h4>

<p>Typefaces with <em>Display</em> or any other word meaning <em>large</em> in their names are designed to be set at 24 points and up.</p>
