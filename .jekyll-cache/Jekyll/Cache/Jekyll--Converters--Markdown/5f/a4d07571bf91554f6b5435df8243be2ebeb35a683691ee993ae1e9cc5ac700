<p>Go to the <a href="your-clients.html">Restaurants page</a> to read up and research which restaurant you want to work for. Make sure to go to their web sites. If you see their menu there, assume you’re completely re-designing it. You don’t even need to base your design on their aesthetics if you don’t want to. You can approach this project as if it’s part of a complete redesign.</p>

<h4 id="research--brainstorming">Research &amp; Brainstorming</h4>

<p>Investigate the restaurant you’ve chosen. They each have a back-story or they have location or style that will inform your design. You need to find in this research opportunities for design solutions.</p>

<p>Propose your concept to the client. You can include type selection, hierarchy and treatments; graphics and treatments; colours, and more. Your PDF can be more than one page.</p>

<p>Remember that you’re pitching this to a non-designer. Organize the page layout so items are distinct from each other. You <em>could</em> make a page for colour, then a page for <em>type</em> and so on. Organize your pitch as you see fit. Just keep the client’s point-of-view in mind.</p>

<h4 id="development--iteration">Development &amp; Iteration</h4>

<p>Work on an overall plan for your menu. Draw this out on paper. You should end up with a high-fidelity rendering of your menu on paper. This should be presentable to the client.</p>

<h4 id="production">Production</h4>

<p>You’ll build your design in InDesign, using Illustrator for vectors and Photoshop for raster imagery.</p>

<p>You’ll need to ensure that the files are print-ready. This isn’t a big deal. Limit and control your font usage. Use only high-resolution images, if you use raster images at all. Create vectors in Illustrator, then import the .ai file into InDesign. Keep your project folder organized.</p>

<h4 id="submission">Submission</h4>

<p>You’ll need to make sure to keep your working folder organized for this project since you may have vector and raster files. <a href="deliverables.html">See the submission instructions</a> for more details.</p>
