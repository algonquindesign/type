I"<p>If you’re having trouble finding two typefaces that really go well together, there are type designs which include multiple styles based on the same design.</p>

<p>As you can see below, we have examples of type designs in multiple categories, serifs, sans and slabs.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/kb/serifs-sans-slabs.svg" alt="Serifs, Sans &amp; Slabs" width="90%" />
The families are <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=museo">Museo</a>, <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=corporate">Corporate</a>, <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=adelle">Adelle</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/search?query=skolar">Skolar</a>. There are more of these on Adobe Fonts. One easy way to find them is to do a search with the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sans</code>. Often, when a typeface has the word sans in the name, there’s a serif design to complement it.</p>

<p>When you use these, you can be sure that they work well together because they were designed that way.</p>
