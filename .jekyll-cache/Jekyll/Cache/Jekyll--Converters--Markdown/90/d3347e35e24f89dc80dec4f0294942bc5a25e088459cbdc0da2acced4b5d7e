<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicule" target="_blank">The manicule</a> originates from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts to bring attention to something in the text from the margins. Today, itâ€™s just another dingbat in a world replete with them.</p>

<p>It is often used as a simple page decoration or a bullet glyph. Sadly, it is sometimes used as a computer cursor in poorly designed user interfaces, such as in Adobe Acrobat.</p>

<p>You can easily use the manicule on your mobile device as an emoji. <span style="font-size: 2rem;">ğŸ‘ˆğŸ¼</span></p>
