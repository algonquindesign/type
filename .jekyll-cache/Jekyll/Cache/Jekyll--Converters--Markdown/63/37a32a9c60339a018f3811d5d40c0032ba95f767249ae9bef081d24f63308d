<p>Each of you will be given the name of a modern-day typographer. Youâ€™ll research them to create a profile including:</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>General biographical information</li>
	<li>A head-shot if possible</li>
	<li>A synopsis of their career</li>
	<li>Notable typefaces they've designed, with prominent samples on your page so we can see their designs and their style.</li>
	<li>What was their approach, goal, their philosophy in their type design?</li>
	<li>Their web site and social media handles, if possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâ€™ll present these at the start of each class. Weâ€™ll likely do two or three per week. Theyâ€™ll only be a few minutes each.</p>

<h3 id="your-task">Your Task</h3>

<p>Create a single-page letter-sized bio in InDesign. The layout should be inspired by the typographerâ€™s typefaces. Other than that, the design is up to you. Weâ€™ll share your document with the class so everyone has a bio of each typographer.</p>

<h4 id="write-your-own-text">Write Your Own Text</h4>

<p>This assignment requires that you write your own content. It is forbidden to copy text from the web or any other source. When doing one of these assignments. I suggest make your own notes in bullet list form based on your research. Once youâ€™ve done your research you can re-write the text in your own words. Be sure there isnâ€™t even one sentence that is not your own.</p>

<p>No matter how good a writer you are, itâ€™s always a good idea to have someone else proof-read your text.</p>

<h4 id="avoid-reading">Avoid Reading</h4>

<p>Once you have your page layout done, get familiar with the content. When you present, avoid reading the text. Try to speak it in a more natural manner. Just talk to us about the individual while referring to the key points on your sheet.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve got this!</p>
