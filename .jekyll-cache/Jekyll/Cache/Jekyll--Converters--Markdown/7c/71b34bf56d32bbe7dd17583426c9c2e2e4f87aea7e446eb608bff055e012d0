I"Ô<p>The Unicode system include approximately 150,000 glyphs from over 160 writing systems. You can see a <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/">list of writing systems here</a>. It also defines the international standards for over 3,500 emoji. The standard has a goal of bringing together all the disperate systems which have developed in time, throughout the world.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>

<p>The Unicode system is comprised of codes which are transformed into bytes of information on your computer. The codes look like this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">U+0026</code>, which is <strong>&amp;</strong>, the ampersand. Itâ€™s always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">U+</code> followed by four or five digits. This encoding allows for over one million assignable codes.</p>

<p>The code is like a structure on which the glyph is painted. Different operating systems can apply their own paint to a code. Thatâ€™s why emoji look different on iOS compared to Windows or Facebook. Each paints their own emoji artwork on a Unicode code.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 48px;">U+1F602 = ðŸ˜‚</span></p>

<p>This particular one is described as <em>face with tears of joy</em>. You can see what how each platform paints emoji <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f602">on this site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-should-i-care">Why Should I Care?</h3>

<p>First, itâ€™s simply important to know how the tools of your trade work.</p>

<p>Have you ever gotten strange, jumbled characters when you imported text into InDesign? That is caused by incorrect character encoding. If you save the text file to UTF-8 encoding, it will render the problem glyphs properly in InDesign.</p>

<p>Character encoding can affect our daily lives as designers.</p>

<h3 id="unicode-and-typography">Unicode and Typography</h3>

<p>When a typographer designs a typeface, theyâ€™re painting their design onto each Unicode code. The typographer has the choice of how many of the codes theyâ€™re going to use. Most typefaces only include what the typographer judges is the necessary complement of glyphs for a given writing system (Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, etcâ€¦)</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s a <strong>â˜’</strong> in it in your text, thatâ€™s because the typeface does not include a glyph for that code. <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/">This is a great web site</a> to find Unicode information.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-use-unicode">How Can I Use Unicode?</h3>

<p>In InDesign, you can use Unicode to search and replace glyphs. Thereâ€™s a GLYPHS tab in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Find/Change</code> dialogue. It allows you to find a glyph, then replace it with the code for a new one. You could, for example, replace this 16/4 with 16 Ã· 4.</p>

<p>In HTML, you can include any Unicode glyph by wrapping it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;#xCODE;</code>. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;#x00BC;</code> will give you Â¼ rather than 1/4.</p>

<p>No matter which platform youâ€™re using, you can always search for a Unicode code to insert a specific glyph in your designs. The only caveat is that itâ€™s designed into the typeface youâ€™re using.</p>
