<p>Start with the broadest view, then work towards the specifics. Whatâ€™s below is minimum suggested content. Depending on your two families, there may be more elements to compare.</p>

<p>You will <strong>not</strong> compare all the instances in the families. Choose the regular weight in each family to compare. You can also compare how they italicize.</p>

<h3 id="broadest-view">Broadest View</h3>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>Where do the two families situate themselves in typographic history?</li>
	<li>When were they released?</li>
	<li>Who are the designers?</li>
	<li>What is the name of the type foundry?</li>
	<li>Did they have a specific purpose when they were designed?</li>
	<li>Show each of the families in paragraph form.</li>
</ul>

<p>If applicable, you can include the foundry for your version of the type family. There may also be a historical version. Take Futura as an example. This version is Futura URW. Thatâ€™s the modern-day design. There exists a historical design, also. You should mention that one in your presentation.</p>

<h3 id="family-comparison">Family Comparison</h3>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>How many instances are there in each family?</li>
	<li>Compare the two familiesâ€˜ glyph complements.</li>
	<li>Do the families include ornaments?</li>
	<li>Are there multiple writing systems? Cyrillic, Greek, etcâ€¦</li>
</ul>

<p>You can include a type waterfall if itâ€™s appropriate to your presentation. In the case of very large families, like <em>Acumin</em> displayed below, it can really showcase the enormous size of the family.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/type-waterfall.svg" alt="Type Waterfall" width="50%" /></p>

<p>These items are a minimum suggested elements to compare. Your families may have other elements to compare depending on their designs.</p>

<h3 id="general-glyph-comparison">General Glyph Comparison</h3>

<p>These characters inform the proportions for the whole family.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/general-comparison.svg" alt="Proportion" width="90%" /></p>

<ul class="hasBullets columns3">
	<li>x-height</li>
	<li>cap height</li>
	<li>stroke contrast</li>
	<li>serifs or terminals</li>
	<li>ascenders and descenders</li>
</ul>

<p>The lower case <em>o</em> establishes overshoot. The cap <em>H</em> and <em>O</em> establish the width and the height for caps. The <em>n</em> and the <em>H</em> provide patterns for serif structure across the familyâ€”full serifs, half serifs and wedge serifs.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/serifs.svg" alt="Serifs" width="60%" /></p>

<h3 id="some-specifics-to-compare">Some Specifics to Compare</h3>

<h4 id="general-shape">General Shape</h4>

<p>Is the face round, open? Is the speed of the curve slow or fast?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/general-shape.svg" alt="General Shape" width="40%" /></p>

<p>The letter <em>O</em> on the left has a slower curve than the one on the right.</p>

<h4 id="x-height">X-Height</h4>

<p>This is a key measurement that conveys the appearance of size for the family. This has an important effect at small and large sizes. What impact does this have on a block of text set at the same type size for the two families?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/nx-x-height.svg" alt="x-height" width="45%" /></p>

<h4 id="serifs-andor-terminals">Serifs and/or Terminals</h4>

<p>How do the terminals compare? Are they bracketed serifs? Angled sans-serif terminals? Describe their general shape. How do they change with italics?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/terminals.svg" alt="Terminals" width="40%" /></p>

<h4 id="stroke-contrast">Stroke Contrast</h4>

<p>How does the thinnest part of a glyph compare to the thickest? How quickly does the thick-thin transition happen?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/stroke-contrast.svg" alt="Stroke contrast" width="90%" /></p>

<h4 id="counters">Counters</h4>

<p>Compare the open counters of either the <em>h m n u</em>. The closed counters of either of the <em>b d p q</em> and of the <em>o</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/counters.svg" alt="Counters" width="90%" /></p>

<p>You can also compare the relationship between open counters and angles, if they are of note.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/counters-v.svg" alt="Counters" width="90%" /></p>

<p>Is your typeface geometric? If so, how far is it from being perfectly round? They never really are. If itâ€™s not geometric, compare slant and stroke weight contrast.</p>

<h4 id="geometric-or-not">Geometric, or not?</h4>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/o.svg" alt="Compare the o glyph across families" width="85%" /></p>

<h4 id="other-standout-features">Other Standout Features</h4>

<p>Do your type families have any particular features that stand out? Below, we see a very geometric glyph on the left. The one on the right is curved and features a trapezoidal tittle.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/comparative-analysis/standount-features.svg" alt="Curved Strokes" width="25%" /></p>

<h3 id="your-text">Your Text</h3>

<p>Please do not copy-paste text from the Web, or any other source into your presentation. Compile all the information about your typefaces in a text editor. Organize and consolidate the content. Read everything to internalize the knowledge. In your presentation, write what you know <strong>in your words</strong>. Doing otherwise will be considered plagiarism.</p>

<h3 id="individual-glyphs">Individual Glyphs</h3>

<p>You can choose among these individual glyphs to highlight difference and similarities between the two families.</p>

<p>The entire shape of the ampersand should be compared, as well as numbers, punctuation marks and diacritics (accents).</p>

<h3 id="fonts-in-use">Fonts in Use</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s a good idea to include graphics of your two type families in use. They can be famous logos, advertisements, web pages, etcâ€¦ Are there famous applications of either of your typefaces?</p>
