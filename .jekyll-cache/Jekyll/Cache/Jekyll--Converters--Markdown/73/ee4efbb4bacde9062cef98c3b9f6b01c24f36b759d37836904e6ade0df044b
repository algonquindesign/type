I"F<p>Now that you have your whole design complete as sketches, colour palette and type selection, it‚Äôs time to build it in InDesign. It‚Äôs crucial that you set up your InDesign document properly at the outset.</p>

<h3 id="units-of-measure">Units of Measure</h3>

<p>Points and Picas are often used in design for print. This is an explanation of these ancient units of measure.</p>

<p><img src="/svg/sell-sheet/points-picas-inches.svg" alt="Points, Picas and Inches" title="points-picas-inches.svg" width="80%" /></p>

<p>It may take time for you to get used to using them, but they are useful. We use points to measure type. It stands to reason we‚Äôll use picas, too. They‚Äôre all part of the same  <a href="https://type.algonquindesign.ca/kb/measuring-type.html">measurement system</a>.</p>

<h3 id="colour-your-world">Colour Your World</h3>

<p>You should also be adding your colours to the swatches panel in InDesign to ensure your  design remains consistent as you build it. Colour swatches are global by default in InDesign. That means, when you add your colours to the Swatches panel, they‚Äôll be editable from there. If you edit the swatch, the colours will change on the page.</p>

<h3 id="the-grid-is-gold">The Grid is Gold</h3>

<p>One of the main goals of this assignment is to have you work on a modular grid, as shown below. What we have here is a 6-column grid on a letter page. As you can see, it‚Äôs mostly used as a 3-column grid with half increments, in case you need them.</p>

<p><img src="/svg/sell-sheet/6-column-page-grid.svg" alt="6-Column Page Layout Grid" title="6-column-page-grid.svg" width="80%" /></p>

<p>You could also do an 8-column grid, which essentially works as a 4-column, with half increments.</p>

<h4 id="let-it-bleed">Let It Bleed</h4>

<p>Be sure to make your bleeds correctly. If any art goes beyond the margins, it needs to reach out to the bleed line and no further.</p>

<p><img src="/svg/bleeds.svg" alt="Correct Bleeds" title="bleeds.svg" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Take a moment to look at this graphic to ensure you really understand what an accurate bleed is.</p>

<h3 id="type-handling">Type Handling</h3>

<p>You‚Äôll have already established your type selection and hierarchy. Now‚Äôs the time to set up <strong>paragraph styles for all your type</strong>. You could/should do this at the start. When you import your text, you can apply the styles right away. If some sizes aren‚Äôt right, it‚Äôs easy to then adjust them.</p>

<p>The rule in InDesign is to create as few text frames as possible. If content can be in fewer fames, do that. If it‚Äôs more complicated to place content in one frame, then use two.</p>

<h4 id="clean-up-your-fonts">Clean Up Your Fonts</h4>

<p>You need to make sure your InDesign document only contains the fonts you‚Äôre actually using in your design. To that end, go to <span class="command">Type &gt; Find/Replace Font‚Ä¶</span>. If there are stray fonts in there, remove them.</p>

<h3 id="image-handling">Image Handling</h3>

<p>There are a number of photos provided by the client. Always use <span class="command">File &gt; Place‚Ä¶</span> to import them. You can scale them in InDesign as you work. Once you‚Äôre done, go to Photoshop to scale them to 100%.</p>
