<h3 id="prepare-print-ready-files">Prepare Print-Ready Files</h3>

<p>All the assignments you submit in Typography courses should be print ready. This is what you have to check before packaging your files.</p>

<h4 id="file-organization">File Organization</h4>

<p>As you work, keep your files organized in a project folder. You should have your main page-layout file.</p>

<h4 id="rgb-colour">RGB Colour</h4>

<p>When the project calls for RGB colour, there should be no spot colours in any of the files you submit. Empty your swatches panel of all unused colours.</p>

<h4 id="font-files">Font files</h4>

<p>As weâ€™ll only be using Adobe Fonts, thereâ€™s not much to do here. No fonts will ever be packaged with your projects, so you have nothing to worry about. Be sure to check <span class="command">Type &gt; Find Fontsâ€¦</span> to ensure only the fonts youâ€™re using are in your document.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s a font folder in your package folder, thereâ€™s a problem. Look inside to see whatâ€™s there. Itâ€™s not an Adobe Font, so you need to go remove it from your InDesign file, then package it again.</p>

<h3 id="your-submission-folder">Your Submission Folder</h3>

<p>Be sure your InDesign document is named as usual:</p>

<p><strong>appleseed-johnny-010-comparative-analysis.indd</strong></p>

<p>Never rename a file while itâ€™s open. Close it. Rename it in Finder, then re-open it.</p>

<p>When you package your InDesign document with <span class="command">File &gt; Packageâ€¦</span> It will create a folder thatâ€™s properly named if your file was well named to start with.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4001/svg/submission-indesign-package.svg" alt="Full InDesign package" width="50%" /></p>

<h3 id="pdf-setup">PDF Setup</h3>

<p>Open your PDF in Adobe Acrobat. Hit <span class="command">âŒ˜-d</span>. Choose these settings:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Layout and Magnification</th>
      <th>Â </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Navigation tab:</td>
      <td>Pages Panel and Page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Page layout:</td>
      <td>Single Page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Magnification:</td>
      <td>Fit Page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Open to page:</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Save, then close your PDF file. Zip, then submit the whole InDesign package folder.</p>
