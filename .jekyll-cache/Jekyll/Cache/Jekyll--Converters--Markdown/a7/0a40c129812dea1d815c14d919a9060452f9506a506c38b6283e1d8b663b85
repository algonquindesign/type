<p>Copy and paste <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~spok/grimmtmp/" title="Get the text for your fairy tale." target="_blank">the text from the web page</a> to a text editor or into InDesign. You’ll want to use the Find/Change command in your text editor to remove:</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>double spaces</li>
	<li>double paragraph breaks</li>
	<li>any tab characters</li>
</ul>

<p>If ever your text happens to have giant, long paragraphs, find a logical spot to add paragraph breaks as needed.</p>

<p>Read through your story. When I read mine, there were question marks missing in the quotations. Also, add quotation marks throughout the text where people are speaking. This is how to apply them. Note where the punctuation is in the different examples.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Birds of a feather flock together, let us remain together, and seek our way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know that myself”, answered the huntsman, “I have lost my way in the forest”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See how the punctuation is sometimes on the inside of the quote marks and sometimes on the outside? If the whole sentence is a spoken one, the quotes go on the outside. If not, they go on the inside.</p>

<p>You’re going to use all the text from your story. Let it take as many pages as necessary. If you have a few lines of text left at the end, send them to an overset text frame.</p>

<p>The important work is done at the outset. Document setup, margin setup and Parent Pages are where the action happens.</p>

<p>You’ll want to create your pages to fit the dust cover you just completed. Remember that the front of the trimmed dust cover measured 12cm wide by 20cm tall. That means that each page will need to be three or four millimetres smaller than the cover. You need to figure out your dimensions.</p>

<p>You can create a document with a few pages, then add more as needed to accomodate the length of your story.</p>

<p>Now you need to set up text frames on Parent Pages and style sheets.</p>
