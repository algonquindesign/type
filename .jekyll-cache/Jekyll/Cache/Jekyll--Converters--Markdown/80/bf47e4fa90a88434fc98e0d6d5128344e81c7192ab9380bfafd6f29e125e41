<p>Once you‚Äôve chosen your type family, you should explore its glyph complement, its <em>repertoire</em>. You can see this in the Glyphs panel in Illustrator. You can even filter through glyphs by category. [<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/glyphs-special-characters.html">support link</a>] Hopefully there‚Äôll be some beauties in there you can highlight on your poster.</p>

<h4 id="thumbnails">Thumbnails</h4>

<p>Start with the traditional thumbnails. Since this is such a large poster, it‚Äôs tough to make a small thumbnail represent the full-sized artwork. I suggest making your thumbnails a quarter of a letter sheet instead.</p>

<p>Produce lots. Show me. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<h4 id="higher-fidelity-rendering">High(er)-Fidelity Rendering</h4>

<p>Once you‚Äôve refined your concepts, you can create a higher fidelity version of your poster. This can be on a full letter or tabloid sized sheet. Remember to use the proportions of the final poster. It measures 12‚Äù x 18‚Äù. That‚Äôs a 2:3 ratio, so you can make your high-fi rendering 6‚Äù by 9‚Äù on a letter sheet or 8‚Äù by 12‚Äù on a tabloid sheet.</p>

<p>This is what you‚Äôll base your final poster on. Once you have this done, the creative process is pretty much complete. On to building the final file for production!</p>

<p>Create a single-page PDF mood board. If we were cooking, this would be all the ingredients laid out on the counter. From them, we could see what the dish will be. It should include:</p>

<ul class="hasBullets">
	<li>colour swatches</li>
	<li>type specimens</li>
	<li>a small sample of the type treatment</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="type-size">Type Size</h3>

<p>Be sure to print a section of your poster at 100%. Check the size of the smallest text to ensure it‚Äôs large enough to read from 2 metres away.</p>
