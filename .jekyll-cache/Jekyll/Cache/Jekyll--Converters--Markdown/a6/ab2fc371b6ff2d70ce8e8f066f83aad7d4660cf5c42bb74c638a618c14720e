  <li>Our focus is always on inviting, comfortable, readable type that flows from page to page.</li>
  <li>Line length for readable body copy should not exceed 3.5 to 4” in length. If required, use two columns of text rather than one long line length. Alley sizing between columns should be default so there is a flow of information and not two Gutenberg styled columns of text on the page (default is 1pica or .1667 inches)</li>
  <li>
    <p>It is acceptable to use sans serif for body copy but since sans serif tends to have a larger x-height, we can set it smaller than a serif typeface. It also requires more leading to be readable. (Especially for a lot of text).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Be mindful of the rag in typesetting and how many words are on a line within a column to ensure you are setting type at the right size. Body copy, depending on the xheight of the font is set somewhere between 9 and 11 pt (Helvetica can be set at 9pt and Garamond can be set at 11pt).</li>
  <li>Subheads require a bit of space after them and sub subheaders can usually sit atop body copy. </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use contrasting fonts for Titles and Subheaders alongside sub subheads and body copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We use quotation marks only when we are quoting someone. To highlight important text, we use italics. Italics are also used for names of fonts such as Helvetica, reference to individual letters such as the use of a large A in my layout, definitions such as “His name in Hebrew means Peace”, names of works of art or publications such as DaVinci’s Vitruvian Man or the Guttenberg Bible. We do not italicize names of businesses or people.</li>
  <li>Use proper smart quotes and not tick marks for actual quotations.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Bulleted text uses hanging punctuation (text aligns after bullets with reasonable space between bullets and text). Same goes for pull quotes where quotation marks are used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Paragraphs are either indented about 3 4 letters for 3.5 4” wide paragraphs or we leave a space between paragraphs. We never use both options.</li>
  <li>The word to as in 9 to 5 can be replaced with an en dash. An en dash means to.</li>
  <li>An em dash is used to highlight text — something important to consider or for a pause in thought. It is also used before the name of someone who is being quoted if the quote is highlighted and the name is below it. We can also use it for omitted text as in “Don’t blame me when the s— hits the fan”.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Hyphens are used for phone numbers and for hyphenated text. Hyphens are needed to balance out a rag so that it is not severe. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Large text needs to be tracked closer together. Spacing is built into body copy but as text gets larger, so does the space between letters. Be mindful of this and track large titles tighter. Use kerning as necessary.</li>
  <li>AM and PM are set in small caps. No lowercase and no periods used. Same for BCE or MD.</li>
  <li>
    <p>A postal code has 2 spaces between it and the end of the province name it follows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use Phrasing for small amounts of text. Phrasing is paying attention to line breaks and natural pauses when reading a small amount of text, like when reading a wedding invitation. Keep information together that belongs together.</li>
</ul>
