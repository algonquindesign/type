I"•<p><em>It is unwise to pay too much.</em><br />
<em>It is worse to pay too little.</em></p>

<p><em>When you pay too much, you lose a little money; that is all.</em></p>

<p><em>When you pay to little, you sometimes lose everything;</em><br />
<em>because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.</em></p>

<p><em>The common law of business balances prohibits paying a little and getting allot.</em></p>

<p><em>If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run. If you do that, you will have enough to pay for something better.</em></p>

<p><em>There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper. People who consider price alone are this manâ€™s lawful prey.</em></p>
