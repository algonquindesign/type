title: Your Price is Too High
deck: "The following is good practice in your personal and in your professional life."
---
*It is unwise to pay too much.*  
*It is worse to pay too little.*

*When you pay too much, you lose a little money; that is all.*

*When you pay to little, you sometimes lose everything;*  
*because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.*

*The common law of business balances prohibits paying a little and getting allot.*

*If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run. If you do that, you will have enough to pay for something better.*

*There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper. People who consider price alone are this man's lawful prey.*
